Program to compute area of triangle from three points.

Program was built and compiled using CLion.
Program runs successfully.

Testing note:
I'm not sure how you want us to implement the test suite, or if you have a way you'd rather do that.
So main is pretty much blank. I will double check with you in class for future reference.
However, if I'm understanding the test functions correctly, my code should be fine until it tries to 
take the square root of negative numbers. :)
